# Challenge

Stabilize and improve the existing **Liva Clinic** app: fix critical bugs, boost performance, and add new features in the Flutter app and PostgreSQL backend.

---

# Solution

As a freelance developer, I fixed major bugs and optimized the mobile app. On the backend (PostgreSQL + Sequelize), I improve SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, Google Maps API for address verification, and AWS for log monitoring.

# Result

The app became more stable, faster, and user-friendly. New integrations improved communication with patients, data accuracy, and overall clinic operations.
