# Challenge

Building a mobile app for ice cream vans. Key requirements: user role management, maps with real-time van locations, **background location** for automatic vendor location tracking, and push notifications to alert customers when a van is nearby.

---

# Solution

In the **Ice Cream Time** project, I implemented van listings, user roles, Google Maps integration, and **background location**, enabling vendors to automatically send their coordinates to the database and trigger push notifications for nearby customers.

# Result

Customers can quickly find the closest ice cream vans, while vendors can attract more clients through maps, real-time location updates, and push notifications.
